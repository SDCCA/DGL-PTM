This model was trained on 23 July after a change was made to the Bellman equation (not to shock all assets but just those carried over). 
This model was selected as the superior architecture and combination of hyperparameters produced the closest match to the results of the iterative equation. 
It is to be used with the nn_bellman_past_shock_consumption method.
Fun note: Said arch/combination is identical to the superior arrangement resulting from the previous grid search for the first version of the Bellman equation.
